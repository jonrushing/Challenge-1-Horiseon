# Challenge 1 (Horiseon)

## Description 
This is the first challenged I was assigned in my coding bootcamp. In it we were given the HTML and CSS code to the front page of a sample website (Horiseon) that, coding wise, contained what some might call "div soup". We were asked to make the website more accessible utilising semantic HTML. Semantic HTML is a great way to not only organise your code but to allow your site to be used by screen readers.

## Want to take a peak?
Simply clone the git repo and open it up in VSCode or any similar coding software. Another option is to look through the HTML index right here on Github. I wrote some notes in the HTML index of all the changes I made.
